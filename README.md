# Getting Started with this Pokedex

My objective with this repo is to apply a lot of different best practices, techniques, tools and ideas and document them along the way.

It starts with a simple pokesearch, consuming the public PokeAPI.
The code smells and have a lot of work to do, that's the objective.

To start, I'm going to implement some tests and enable some code quality tools such as CodeClimate.

This is a live documentation, for now, so it'll change.
